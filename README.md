# HPC-FineTuning-Examples
HPC Fine-Tuning Examples repository dedicated to providing examples and tutorials for fine-tuning language models using HPC system Devana.
Our goal is to help researchers and practitioners efficiently leverage HPC infrastructure to enhance their NLP workflows.

## Contents
- **Embedding Indices**: This repository provides scripts for building information retrieval tool using BGE embeddings - BGE-M3 model, to retrieve similar documents from the 20 Newsgroups dataset using an Annoy index.
- **NER**: This repository contains scripts and utilities for training DistilBERT model for Named Entity Recognition (NER). The model is fine-tuned on the CoNLL-2003 dataset, which includes named entities such as persons (PER), organizations (ORG), locations (LOC), and miscellaneous entities (MISC).

- **Sentiment Analysis**: This repository provides scripts to train a BERT model for sentiment analysis using the Twitter dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference.
- **LLM Inference**: This repository contains scripts for running inference on a pre-trained language model (LLM) using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The scripts demonstrate how to load a pre-trained model, tokenize input text, and generate output text.
- **LLM Training**: This repository provides scripts for fine-tuning a pre-trained language model (LLM) using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The scripts demonstrate how to load a pre-trained model, tokenize input text, and train the model on a custom dataset.

**Note:** Customize paths and file names as necessary based on your project structure and requirements.
The tutorial scripts download data and models from the internet, so it's necessary to use a node with internet access to run these scripts for the first time. The downloaded files will then be saved in cache for subsequent runs.

## Requirements

To use the examples provided in this repository, you have two options:

1. **Use an Existing Singularity Image**: Utilize the existing Singularity image named `pt-2.3_llm.sif`, which contains all the necessary libraries.
2. **Create a New Singularity Image**: Follow the instructions below to create a new Singularity image.

### Instructions for Creating a New Singularity Image:

- **Singularity**: Ensure you have Singularity-CE version 3.10 or higher installed.
- **Recipe File**: Use the Singularity recipe file named `pt_devel_llm.recipe`.
- **Build Command**: To build a Singularity image from the recipe file, use the following command:

  ```sh
  sudo singularity build test.sif pt_devel_llm.recipe

## Hugging Face Token Setup
Some of the scripts require that you have account and the [access token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens) generated at the [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) website. The token is used to access some models. The token should be added to the code as a string as shown at the [access token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens).

### Example: Loading a Model with an Access Token

To load a model using an access token, you can use the following code snippet:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_id = "your-model-id"
access_token = "your-access-token"

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_id,
    token=access_token,  # Add the access token here
    device_map='cuda'
)

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(
    model_id,
    token=access_token  # Add the access token here
)
```

Before accessing certain models, you may need to agree to the conditions on the model card on the Hugging Face website, including sharing your contact information (email and username) with the repository authors.
